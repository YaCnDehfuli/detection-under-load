"""Explain why a rule did not fire on a capture.

A benchmark that counts every non-firing rule as a failure is measuring the
capture as much as the rule. Sysmon configurations differ, and a rule that
needs CallTrace cannot be blamed when the capture never recorded CallTrace.
Every miss lands in one of three classes:

  miss-telemetry   the capture lacks the event type or the field the rule reads
  out-of-scope     the rule is keyed to a named binary that is not in the capture
  miss-logic       the inputs were all there and the rule still did not match

Only miss-logic says anything about the rule's quality, so only miss-logic
feeds the headline.
